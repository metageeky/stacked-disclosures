			<h1 id="page-title">Stacked Disclosure Pattern</h1>

			<p>
				The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/#accordion">accordion 
				widget pattern</a> consists of a set of associated disclosure panels. Each panel 
				can be opened or closed individually with the purpose of reducing the need to 
				scroll through multiple sections on a page. Commonly, the accordion will 
				typically limit it to only ONE panel open at a time. If a panel is open and 
				the user opens another one, the other closes. This comes off as a potential 
				antipattern in that the accordion can prevent the user from comparing the content 
				in different panels. The accordion pattern works if the panel contents are truly 
				independent of each other. That is rarely the case.
			</p>
			<p>
				The <strong>stacked disclosure pattern</strong> presented here is a similar 
				approach to the accordion pattern but permits multiple patterns to be open 
				at any time. Additional features include controls to easily open or close all 
				panels at once.
			</p>

			<h2>Example</h2>

			<h2>Design Aspects</h2>

			

			<ul>
				<li>Progressive enhancement via being open by default. 
				<li>Disclosures close on page load via a mutation observer to avoid screen repaints
				<li>If no mutation observers, there's a backup
				<li>Examples using headings or without heading. Best practices for them.
				<li>Mention stuff about how headings should be used in this
			</ul>

			<h3> 
				Why not use the <code>&lt;details&gt;</code> element?
			</h3>
			<p> 
				The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/details">
				<code>&lt;details&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;summary&gt;</code></a> elements were 
				added in HTML5 to provide a native disclosure element. Unfortunately, these 
				elements are not a viable replacement for either the accordion or stacked 
				disclosure patterns. The reasons are multi-fold:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					To meet the required interactions for either pattern, additional JavaScript
					code would be required in addition to the native behaviors. 
				</li>
				<li>
					The <code>&lt;summary&gt;</code> element cannot contain headings despite those
					being a recommended practice as that leads to the 
					<a href="https://daverupert.com/2019/12/why-details-is-not-an-accordion/">heading 
					not being exposed</a> to screen readers. This is a known <a href="https://github.com/FreedomScientific/VFO-standards-support/issues/105">ongoing 
					access issue</a>.
				</li>
				<li>
					Although support for these new elements continues to grow, many inclusive approaches
					mandate that <a href="https://caniuse.com/?search=details">Can I use...</a>
					statistics for support meet a 
					<a href="https://umnlibraries.github.io/design-system/code/general.html#support">98% 
					threshold</a>. 
				</li>
			</ul>
