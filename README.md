# Stacked Disclosures Widget
The stacked disclosure is a variant of the [accordion pattern](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/#accordion) designed to meet specific design requirements:

* Each accordion can have any number of disclosure panels opened or closed at any time independent of each other.
* The accordion has options to open or close all the panels at once.
* The overall accordion conforms and possibly exceeds accessibility standards.

Implementation details can be found on the [demo page](https://metageeky.github.io/stacked-disclosures/).
